    "question": "What is a SKALE Bridge?",
    "answer": "A SKALE Bridge is a technology that allows for the transfer of assets and data between two separate blockchain networks. This enables interoperability between different blockchain systems, including the transfer of assets between any pair of SKALE Chain and the Ethereum Mainnet."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a SKALE Bridge work?",
    "answer": "A SKALE Bridge works by establishing a secure connection between two different blockchain networks using cryptographically secure algorithms and is enabled by Interchain Messaging Agents (IMA) that are running on each SKALE Node. This connection allows for the transfer of assets and data between the networks, and can be achieved through a variety of different methods, including cross-chain atomic swaps, hash time-locked contracts, or other forms of multi-party computation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using a SKALE Bridge?",
    "answer": "The benefits of using a SKALE Bridge include increased interoperability and compatibility between different blockchain networks, the ability to transfer assets and data across networks for free, and the ability to create new decentralized applications and services that can operate across multiple blockchain networks, including transfers between SKALE Chain and the Ethereum Mainnet."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any security concerns when using a SKALE Bridge?",
    "answer": "As with any technology, there are potential security risks associated with the use of a SKALE Bridge. These risks can include vulnerabilities in the implementation of the bridge, or malicious actors attempting to exploit the bridge for their own gain. It is important to thoroughly vet and secure any SKALE Bridge before using it, and to regularly monitor it for any potential security threats."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use a SKALE Bridge?",
    "answer": "SKALE Bridges are currently in beta and may have some bugs, so use at your own risk. However, the technology can be used by anyone looking to transfer assets or data between two different blockchain networks, including transfers between SKALE Chain and the Ethereum Mainnet. This includes individuals, businesses, and organizations looking to expand their reach and capabilities across multiple blockchain systems."

  {
    "question": "What is sFUEL?",
    "answer": "sFUEL is the native token of SKALE. This is similar (but different!) to Ether in Ethereum. To interact with a SKALE chain, sFUEL tokens are required to conduct transactions. Unlike Ether and other gas tokens, sFUEL has no value: itâ€™s FREE. There is no payment/cost required for transactions since sFUEL is FREE. Getting sFUEL on a SKALE chain is done through a number of ways. Read more: https://docs.skale.network/develop/sfuel-gas-token"
